# Introduction

Welcome to Akaibu CCNA, a free CCNA tutorial site that closely follows the Cisco CCNA curriculum. The site was designed to help you pass the CCNA exam (200-301), but it can also be used as a reference site for anything networking related. Here you can find all materials needed to study for your CCNA exam.

## How to Use

On the left side you will find a list of articles. The articles on this site are divided by chapters. The first couple of chapters describe some basic networking terms and devices. The later chapters go a little bit in depth. You can start reading the articles from the beginning, or you can find a specific article that interest you.

So, what are you waiting for? Choose a topic on the left and start learning! We wish you luck!
